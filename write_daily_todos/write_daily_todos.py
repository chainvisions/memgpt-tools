    Adds today's todos to the Tasks section of Obsidian daily note.

    This function takes in three different lists of todos organized into must, should, 
    and want categories and writes them to the Obsidian daily note in their respective category.

    Args:
        must (Optional[list[str]]): Today's tasks that are in the must category.
                              If not provided, defaults to none.
        should (Optional[list[str]]): Today's tasks that are in the should category.
                              If not provided, defaults to none.
        want (Optional[list[str]]): Today's tasks that are in the want category.
                              If not provided, defaults to none.

    Returns:
        str: Whether or not the operation succeeded, or an error message if one occurs.
    
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the daily note file does not exist.

    Example:
        >>> write_daily_todos(["do something important"], ["work on something"], ["leisure time"])
